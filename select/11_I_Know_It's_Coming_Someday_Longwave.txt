When all your stenght is wearing thin
Hanging on until the end
I can give you what your looking for
After the years you give in vain
Reaching out to feel again
I can give you what your looking for
Well i know it's coming someday
In the pit of every morning
Well i know it all too well
Know it all too well
And now th epain is kicking in
With every crack it tears the skin
I can feel you when your dying
Look back on the days you lived before
Look back on the nights and ask for more
And when there's no one left
You'll see me there
Well i know it's coming someday
In the glow of every morning
I know you could bring me back
You could bring me back
Yeah well i know it's coming someday
And it just might be tommorrow
Well i know it all too well
Know it all too well
I know it all too well
