There's a young man that I know
Whose age is twenty one
Comes from down in southern Colorado
Just out of the service
He's lookin' for his fun
Someday soon
Goin' with him someday soon

My parents can not stand him
'Cause he rides the rodeo
My father says that he will leave me cryin'
I would follow him right down the roughest road I know
Someday soon
Goin' with him someday soon

But when he comes to call
My pa ain't got a good word to say
Guess it's 'cause he's
Just as wild in his younger days

So blow, you old Blue Northern
Blow my love to me
He's ridin' in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo
As much as he loves me
Someday soon
Goin' with him someday soon

When he comes to call
My pa ain't got a word to say

Just as wild in his younger days

So blow, you old blue northern
Blow my love to me
He's ridin' in tonight from California
He loves his damned old rodeo
As much as he loves me
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon
Someday soon, goin' with him someday soon
