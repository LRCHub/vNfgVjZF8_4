I spend my life away from you, I wish that I could stay with you
Someday, someday.
The way not so clear, you may get away from here someday, someday.
(Someday)

I feel no harm, I feel no pain but I know it can't last forever.
We'll have to start all over.

You plan on the future, wish you find an answer someday, someday.

(Guitar solo)

I spend my life away from you, I wish that I could stay with you
Someday, someday.

I feel no harm, I feel no pain but I know it can't last forever.
We'll have to start all over.

Someday you'll see, we'll hit upon an answer.
You can't fly forever and stay away from me.
Someday you'll see, you can't fly forever, oooh yeah yeah.
Someday you'll see, we'll hit upon an answer.
You can't fly forever and stay away from me.
You're gonna find a way, someday you'll see, we'll hit upon an answer.
You can't fly forever (You can't fly forever) and stay away from me. (Oh)
You're gonna find a way someday. You can't fly forever, no no.
You're gonna find a way someday.
We're gonna fly away someday, someday.
You're gonna find a way someday.
