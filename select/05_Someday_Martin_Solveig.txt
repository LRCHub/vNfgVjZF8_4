(Martin Solveig)
I spin my life away from you, I wish that I could stay with you
Someday, someday.
The way not so clear, you may get away from here someday, someday.
I feel no harm, I feel no pain but I know it can't last forever.
We'll have to start all over.
You planned on the future, wished upon an answer someday, someday.
[Guitar solo]
I spin my life away from you, I wish that I could stay with you
Someday, someday.
I feel no harm, I feel no pain but I know it can't last forever.

We'll have to start all over.
Someday you'll see, we'll hit upon an answer.
You can't fly forever and stay away from me.
Someday you'll see, you can't fly forever, oooh yeah yeah.
Someday you'll see, we'll hit upon an answer.
You can't fly forever and stay away from me.
You're gonna find a way, someday you'll see, we'll hit upon an answer.
You can't fly forever and stay away from me. (You can't fly forever, oh)
You're gonna find a way someday.
